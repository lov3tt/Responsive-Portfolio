      <p>Hi, my name is Bobby Quach. I was born in Florida, and graduated from University of Central Florida in 2015 with a B.S Biomedical and minors in Mathematic and BioMath.</p>

      <p>Corgis are my favorite animal! They have that magnificent body shape that allow fairy to ride on their back, and that art of concealment. When laying down they can disguise themselves as a meatloaf when view from behind</p>

      <p>My current life goal, is to own a corgi and name him/her Courage. To commemeroate the cartoon Couragee the cowardly dog, since that show when I was young would always makes me wonder how even the smallest person, would be able to overcome their fear if it's for something they treasure.</p>
